# JavaScript Challenges


### Instructions

Please make the tests in `test\leaftrade.test.js` all pass. To get started, fork the repository and make a feature branch for your answers. Once you're done, create a pull request with your answers.

Create a utility function for each answer and rewrite each test to make the assertions pass. If you do not need a function to complete the tests, make a note in the comments above the test.

NOTE: You can use any third party packages you deem necessary to complete the tests.
